# Lemuria - A Tale

## Description
Lemuria is a text-based RPG built around a Jules Verne-esque landscape. In a space-exploration voyage gone wrong, you have crash landed in the Land of Lemuria - a land being reclaimed by the natural realm after its inhabitants have self-destructed in a technological apocalypse. You must make your way through the treacherous landscape to find someone who may be able to send you back to your own world.
