Dedira materializes above you, her face stretched into a razor sharp grin. 'Ah, now you are food' She descends on you, wrapping her long fingers around your head. Unable to defend yourself any further from this spirit, you embrace the emptiness as she devours the essence of your being. Was this the peace you were seeking?",
